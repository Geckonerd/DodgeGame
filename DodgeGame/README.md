# Overview

This program is intended to be practice for the Python language, with a heavy emphasis on the pygame
library. Video Game Development is what I am aiming for, so this serves as a foundation to my knowledge
that I will build upon as time goes on. In the meantime, this game is a simple game with the goal of jumping
over the balls that are shot at the player. The player gets 3 lives, and once all three are gone, it is game over.

# Development Environment

This program was made in Visual Studio Code using the Python language. I utilized the pygame library
that is provided, giving me the framework I needed to establish this game.

# Future Work

* Highest priority in this project as of now is the debuggining. As of now the collision mechanic
  does not work as intended. So I need to research how I can fix that for the program to properly run.
* Given the current space being used, there is opportunities to include multiple levels that balls can
  come out towards, giving the player more range in where they can move too. This would also be the
  opportunity to increase difficulties in multiple categories.
* Another thing to eventually include would be UI elements, some examples including score, displaying
  how many lives are left, and also the current speed of the ball.
